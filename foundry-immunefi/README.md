# Security Review Project

Generated by Immunefi Instascope - Simple approach with one profile per contract

## Overview
This project contains 2 contracts, each in its own profile for independent compilation.

## Contracts
- **Splitter** (0x03fd3d61423e6d46dcc3917862fbc57653dc3eb0)
- **Splitter** (0x323498d3fb02594ac3e0a11b2dea337893ecabbe)

```

To build a specific contract:
```bash

```
